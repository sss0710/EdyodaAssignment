The most easy method will be to use rolling update.

We can update the update the yaml file and add the following code.

minReadySeconds: 10
strategy:
rollingUpdate:
maxSurge: 1
maxUnavailable: 1
type: RollingUpdate

After making the edit, we have to run the following command.
kubectl set image deployment <image_name>
